# latex-thesis
A LaTeX2e class for easily creating compliant theses.

Currently, the class only supports doctoral theses written in English.

## TODO
 - Create a LaTeX style documentation with examples
 - Generalize the class for bachelor and master theses
 - Make sure it is really compilant with stylistic rules
 - Create a Hungarian localization with babel
